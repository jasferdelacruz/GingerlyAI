## üí° Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

## üèóÔ∏è Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep components small and focused

```javascript
/**
 * Predicts disease from image using TensorFlow.js model
 * @param {string} imageUri - URI of the image to analyze
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Prediction results with confidence scores
 */
async function predictDisease(imageUri) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where applicable
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

```python
def preprocess_image(image_path: str, target_size: tuple = (224, 224)) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Preprocess image for model inference.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the image file
        target_size: Target size for resizing (height, width)
        
    Returns:
        Preprocessed image as numpy array
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Database
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Include migration scripts for schema changes
- Document schema changes in commit messages

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and services
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
- Test offline functionality
- Verify camera and ML integration

### Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for controllers and services
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify database operations

### ML Testing
- Test data preprocessing pipelines
- Validate model training scripts
- Verify model export functionality
- Test inference accuracy

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Write clear function and class documentation
- Update README files when adding features
- Include usage examples

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with parameters
- Include request/response examples
- Specify authentication requirements
- Note any rate limiting or restrictions

## üåç Internationalization

When adding new features:
- Use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings
- Consider right-to-left (RTL) language support
- Test with different locales
- Update translation files

## üîí Security Guidelines

- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords)
- **Validate all user inputs** on both client and server
- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web security
- **Report security issues privately** to maintainers

## üì± Mobile Development

- Verify camera and storage permissions
- Check offline functionality
- Test memory usage during ML inference

### Android Considerations
- Test on different Android versions (API 21+)
- Verify permissions and security
- Check performance on lower-end devices
- Test offline database synchronization

## ü§ñ Machine Learning

### Model Contributions
- Document model architecture changes
- Include performance metrics and comparisons
- Provide training data requirements
- Test model export to TensorFlow.js

### Dataset Guidelines
- Ensure proper licensing for training data
- Document data sources and collection methods
- Maintain data quality standards
- Follow ethical AI practices
