We take the security of GingerlyAI seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### 📧 How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@gingerlyai.com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 🕐 Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (typically 30-90 days)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Backend Security
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Joi schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Sequelize ORM
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS**: Configured for specific origins only
- **HTTPS**: Enforced in production
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

### Mobile App Security
- **Secure Storage**: Capacitor Preferences for sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Certificate pinning for API communications
- **Local Database**: SQLite with encryption capabilities
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions (camera, storage, location)
- **Code Obfuscation**: Production builds are minified and obfuscated

### ML Pipeline Security
- **Model Integrity**: Checksum validation for model files
- **Data Privacy**: Local inference to protect user data
- **Secure Transfer**: Models downloaded over HTTPS
- **Access Control**: Admin-only model management

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Farmers/End Users
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, strong passwords for your account
- **App Updates**: Keep the mobile app updated to the latest version
- **Device Security**: Use device lock screens and biometric authentication
- **Network Safety**: Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
- **Data Backup**: Regularly sync your data to prevent loss

### For Administrators
- **Admin Credentials**: Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
- **Access Logging**: Monitor admin access logs regularly
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions

### For Developers
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies
- **Code Review**: All changes must be reviewed before merging
- **Static Analysis**: Use security linting tools
- **Secure Development**: Follow OWASP guidelines

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Local Storage**: Mobile app stores some data locally (encrypted when possible)
- **Offline Mode**: Some security features may be limited in offline mode
- **ML Models**: Models are downloaded and cached locally

### Planned Improvements
- **Certificate Pinning**: Enhanced network security
- **Biometric Authentication**: For app access
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For sensitive user data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

## 🔍 Security Testing

We regularly conduct:
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment of dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Manual security-focused code reviews

## 📜 Compliance

GingerlyAI aims to comply with:
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation (where applicable)
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **Mobile Security**: OWASP Mobile Security Project guidelines
- **Data Protection**: Local data protection laws

## 🛠️ Security Tools Used

- **Backend**: Helmet.js, bcrypt, JWT, rate-limiting
- **Frontend**: Capacitor security plugins, secure storage
- **CI/CD**: Trivy vulnerability scanner, dependency auditing
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting
