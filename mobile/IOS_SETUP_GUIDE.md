# üçé iOS Setup Guide for GingerlyAI

Complete guide to set up, build, and deploy the GingerlyAI app for iOS devices.

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**

### **Required Software**
- ‚úÖ **macOS** (required for iOS development)
- ‚úÖ **Xcode 14+** (latest version recommended)
- ‚úÖ **CocoaPods** (`sudo gem install cocoapods`)
- ‚úÖ **Node.js 18+** (already installed)
- ‚úÖ **iOS Developer Account** (for App Store deployment)

### **Check if you have the requirements:**
```bash
# Check Xcode version
xcodebuild -version

# Check CocoaPods
pod --version

# Check Node.js
node --version
```

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start: Add iOS Platform**

### **1. Build the Web Assets**
```bash
cd mobile
npm run build
```

### **2. Add iOS Platform**
```bash
# Add iOS platform (only needed once)
npx cap add ios

# Or if already added, sync changes
npx cap sync ios
```

### **3. Open in Xcode**
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This will open Xcode with your iOS project!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **iOS Configuration**

### **Info.plist Permissions**

The iOS app needs specific permissions. These will be automatically added, but here's what they are:

#### **Camera Permissions** (Required for disease detection)
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>GingerlyAI needs camera access to capture images of ginger plants for disease detection and analysis.</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>GingerlyAI needs photo library access to select existing images for disease analysis.</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>GingerlyAI needs permission to save analyzed images to your photo library.</string>
```

#### **Location Permissions** (Optional - for tagging predictions)
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>GingerlyAI uses your location to tag where disease predictions were made, helping track disease patterns.</string>
```

#### **Network Permissions**
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## üé® **App Icons & Splash Screen**

### **App Icon Requirements**
iOS requires multiple icon sizes. Place your icons in:
- `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

**Required Sizes:**
- 20x20 (2x, 3x)
- 29x29 (2x, 3x)
- 40x40 (2x, 3x)
- 60x60 (2x, 3x)
- 76x76 (1x, 2x)
- 83.5x83.5 (2x)
- 1024x1024 (1x)

**Quick Tool**: Use https://appicon.co/ to generate all sizes from one image.

### **Splash Screen**
- iOS uses native launch screens
- Configure in Xcode: `App > LaunchScreen.storyboard`
- Or use Capacitor's splash screen plugin (already configured)

# 2. Uncheck "Automatically manage signing"
# 3. Check it again
# 4. Select your team
```

#### **3. "Build failed" in Xcode**
```bash
# Solution:
# 1. Clean build folder: Product > Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
# 2. Delete derived data:
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
# 3. Try building again
```

#### **4. "App crashes on device but works in simulator"**
```bash
# Check:
# 1. Are you using the Release build configuration?
# 2. Is the model file included in the bundle?
# 3. Are all assets present in the app?
# 4. Check device logs in Xcode: Window > Devices and Simulators
```

#### **5. "Camera permission not showing"**

## üìä **Performance Optimization**

### **ML Model Performance on iOS**
- **iPhone 14 Pro**: ~300-500ms inference
- **iPhone 11**: ~500-800ms inference
- **iPhone SE**: ~800-1200ms inference

### **Optimization Strategies**
1. **Use Core ML** instead of TensorFlow.js for better iOS performance
2. **Quantize model** to 8-bit or 16-bit
3. **Use GPU acceleration** (WebGL backend)
4. **Lazy load model** on first use
5. **Cache predictions** to avoid re-processing

### **Convert to Core ML (Advanced)**
```bash
# If you want native iOS performance:
# 1. Export model to SavedModel format
# 2. Convert to Core ML using coremltools
# 3. Use Core ML in Swift instead of TensorFlow.js
# (10x+ faster but more complex)
```
